Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
Do not lead us into temptations,
But deliver us from the evil one.
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory
Forever and ever, Amen.
